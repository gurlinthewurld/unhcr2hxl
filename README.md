# UNHCR population table

A PHP script translating the UNHCR population database in the **Humanitarian eXchange Language (HXL)** (see [project website](https://sites.google.com/site/hxlproject/) and [hxl.humanitarianresponse.info](http://hxl.humanitarianresponse.info) ).

This current version aims at providing real data for testing. The script takes benefit of the real case but is missing data to be able to reognize locations, persons and organisations. See the sql file for the 2 pcodes tables or the generated logs to check warnings.
